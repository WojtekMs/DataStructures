# DataStructures
This repository contains my implementations of data structures in C++.  
Each data structure has it's own short readme describing the features implemented with it's complexities.

## Configure project
Before you start experimenting with examples please configure the project:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
## BST
In order to run Binary Search Tree examples run:
- `cd build`
- `make BST` (launches example)
- `make BST_test` (launches example tests)
