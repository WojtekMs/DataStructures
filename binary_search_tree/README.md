Basic implementation of Binary Search Tree  
Functions:
- post order traversal (used to delete all the allocated memory)
- in order traversal (used to print the tree)
- element insertion (logarithmic time complexity on average)
- element lookup (logarthimic time complexity on average)
- node depth computation (linear time complexity == number of parent
    nodes relative to chosen node)
- tree height computation (linear time complexity == total number of
    elements in the tree)
